This project contains shared worlds for the Janelia Virtual Reality Interest Group

## Getting your own copy

Club members will need to learn to use "git" to use these worlds
 * Windows users should install TortoiseGit.
 * Then get this repository URL found in the "clone or download" or "copy to clipboard" button above.
 * Browse to a folder of your choice in Windows Explorer (I use a folder called "git" under Documents), right click, and select "Git Clone..."
